# VISUM 

## Background
Visum is the Cost Optimization Tool for Cloud Native Applications. The first version of this project takes a [bottom up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) approach and focuses on cost optimization of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) Applications. However, Apache Spark Application is a private and probably one of more complicated cases of Cloud Native Applications. Later, Visum can be extended to handle any Cloud Native Application.
