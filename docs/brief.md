# Visum - A Cloud Cost Optimization Platform
May 2022


## Background

### 1. Market
The worldwide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market grew 41.4% in 2021, to total $90.9 billion, up from $64.3 billion in 2020. It is expected to be as high as [$121.62 billion](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-top-five-providers-of-infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas) in 2022.

### 2. Customers
Cloud adoption is still growing, and the vast majority of enterprise organizations and more than 50% of SMBs spend more than [a million dollars](https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/#:~:text=Public%20cloud%20continues%20to%20accelerate&text=Thirty%2Dseven%20percent%20of%20enterprises,exceeds%20%241.2%20million%20per%20year.) a year on cloud computing.

## Problem Statement

### 1. Waste
Companies struggle to use cloud resources efficiently. A third of cloud computing investments are being [wasted](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/cloud-spending-wasted-oracle-computing-aws-azure) according to the [Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/) survey of over 750 businesses.

### 2. A Visible Waste
The whole idea of Cloud is elasticity. Cloud will provide as many resources as one requests. Mistakes in resource sizing, scaling in/out, keeping idle resources will result an overspending. This problem is well known. A bunch of companies provide software for financial management of cloud resources.

### 3. An Invisible Waste
Application performance optimization is time-consuming and demands the highest level of expertise.  It is done only when necessary. For example, expert developers invest a lot in application optimization when computing resources are limited, like in embedded systems. 
Cloud Native Applications designed for scalability and run on Cloud where resources are virtually unlimited. And thatâ€™s why Cloud Applications optimization is not necessary. It is done only when the cloud cost skyrockets. So, most of the time Cloud Native Applications are not optimized.
