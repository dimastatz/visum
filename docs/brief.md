# Visum - A Cloud Cost Optimization Platform
May 2022


## Background

### 1. Market
The worldwide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market grew 41.4% in 2021, to total $90.9 billion, up from $64.3 billion in 2020. It is expected to be as high as [$121.62 billion](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-top-five-providers-of-infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas) in 2022.

### 2. Customers
Cloud adoption is still growing, and the vast majority of enterprise organizations and more than 50% of SMBs spend more than [a million dollars](https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/#:~:text=Public%20cloud%20continues%20to%20accelerate&text=Thirty%2Dseven%20percent%20of%20enterprises,exceeds%20%241.2%20million%20per%20year.) a year on cloud computing.

## Problem Statement

### 1. Waste
Companies struggle to use cloud resources efficiently. A third of cloud computing investments are being [wasted](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/cloud-spending-wasted-oracle-computing-aws-azure) according to the [Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/) survey of over 750 businesses.

### 2. A Visible Waste
The whole idea of Cloud is [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(cloud_computing)). Cloud will provide as many resources as one requests. Mistakes in resource sizing, scaling in/out, keeping idle resources will result an overspending. This problem is well known. A bunch of companies provide software for financial management of cloud resources.

### 3. An Invisible Waste
It is 'normal' for [Cloud Native Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing) to be suboptimal from performance point of view. Cloud Native Applications are designed for scalability and run on Cloud where resources are virtually unlimited. When a Cloud Native Application reaches 100% of CPU utilization on production it is easier to scale out resources than execute a hard and time-consuming performance optimization activities. Performance optimization is done only when the cloud cost skyrockets.

### 4. Need or Desire
[40 Billion](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/cloud-spending-wasted-oracle-computing-aws-azure) of US dollars that are wasted yearly, energy efficiency, reducing [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) - all these are good reasons to invest in Cloud Cost Optimization tools.

## Solution
[Visum](https://github.com/dimastatz/visum) is a Cloud Cost Optimization Platform that uses AI techniques to expose and handle an Invisible Waste of Cloud Native Applications. See Visum Github [repo](https://github.com/dimastatz/visum) for high level design.
